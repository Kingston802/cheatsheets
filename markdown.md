# markdown
markdown is a very simple mark up (hah) language that's used widely on github (including in this document)

## headings
```markdown
# headings 
## are 
### added 
#### like this
##### where more hashes
###### makes it smaller
```

you can write text just like normal
```markdown
text will appear on a new line 

if you leave a space

**this will be bold**
*this will be italic*
```

## links 
```markdown
[this is the text to be linked](https://thisiswherethelinkgoes.com)
```

## images
```markdown
![Alt Text](url)
```

## code 
you can include code (with syntax highlighting on github), like so
```markdown
\`\`\`nameoflanguage

\`\`\`
```

## need more?
github has an excellent resource [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
